## üåü Overview

Soul Sound is an innovative web application that bridges the gap between emotional expression and musical discovery. By analyzing the emotional content of journal entries, it provides personalized song recommendations that resonate with your current mood, creating a unique therapeutic experience through music.

## üéØ Problem Statement

To create an AI/ML project that can or may help in real life situations

## üå± Evolution of the Idea

Initially, we thought of making an AI application called "RizzOrRoast" wherein the user rizzes or roasts an AI competitor and the AI does the same with varying intensity and they're scored based on their attempts and lose or gain points accordingly. We then thought what if even a censored bot does a lot of emotional damage that the person feels suicidal and we're held responsible. HENCE, we took an absolute U-turn and created Soul Sound, an emotion based music recommender, which analyzes the emotions of a person from their journal entry and suggests songs based on how they felt on that day. It stores their journal entry and playlists and calms them with music and visually appealing backgrounds.
